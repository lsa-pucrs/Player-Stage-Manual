# Chapter 6 - Building Your Own Drivers
--->

The previous version of this tutorial focus on the constrution of a new scenario (world and models) and on the controller software.
However, if you have to build a new interface or device driver for Player, you will only find out-of-date instructions, such as in [Section 2.3 - Interfaces, Drivers, and
Devices](BASICS.md#23-interfaces-drivers-and-devices). 
Thus, the motivation of this new section is to reduce effort so that new resources can be built for Player.

To be done !
